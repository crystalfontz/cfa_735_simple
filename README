Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------
Fork of https://github.com/crystalfontz/cfa_735_simple 
Original author http://rob.emanuele.us/ 

The firmware running on the LCD provides partially compatible with original CrystalFontz API. 
There are 35 commands in total documented in the CFA-735-xxx-KT_Data_Sheet. 
This part of README file covers extensions for the command set and changes in the command set.

Not supported commands:

*  2 (0x02): Write User Flash Area - not supported
*  3 (0x03): Read User Flash Area - not supported
*  4 (0x04): Store Current State As Boot State - not supported
*  5 (0x05): Reset Functions - not supported
*  16 (0x10): Set Up Fan Reporting (FBSCAB required) - not supported
*  17 (0x11): Set Fan Power (FBSCABrequired)
*  18 (0x12): Read DOW Device Information (FBSCAB required)
*  19 (0x13): Set Up Temperature Reporting (FBSCAB required)
*  20 (0x14): Arbitrary DOW Transaction (FBSCAB required)
*  25 (0x19): Set Fan Power Fail-Safe (FBSCAB required)
*  26 (0x1A): Set Fan Tachometer Glitch Filter (FBSCAB required)
*  27 (0x1B): Query Fan Power & Fail-Safe Mask (FBSCAB required)
*  28 (0x1C): Set ATX Power Switch Functionality
*  29 (0x1D): Enable/Disable and Reset the Watchdog

Modified commands:


*  9 (0x09): Set LCD Special Character Data

First byte of the payload - index of the special character. The legal value for the index is 0-255.
The command will store the characters in the RAM

*  31 (0x1F): Send Data to LCD
Payload bytes [2-21] contains codes of the characters. 
The default characters table follows the Figure 25, but instead of English ABC there are Cyrillic letters.

HowTo 
--------------------------------------------------------------

 Prerequisites.
   
*  STMLink v2 or similar
*  Open OCD
*  ST-LINK In-circuit debugger and programmer for STM8 and STM32 MCUs  (download from http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/219866.jsp)
*  Linux, Windows
*  Optional LCDProc

  Preparations.
  
1. Connect JTAG
2. Bring up the ST-LINK (runs only Windows)
3. Keep the reset pin on the H1 connector low. Connect the ping to the ground if needed, but do not solder.
4. From ST-LINK utility reset the card and disable write protect (menu options byte)
5. Erase the FLASH (this is probably a good idea to save the original LCD firmware first)

The card is ready for the custom firmware

  Compilation and programming
   
1. Open the JTAG device using OpenOCD: sudo ../src/openocd  -f board/stm32vldiscovery.cfg
2. Open telnet: telnet localhost 4444 
3. Compile the firmware make -C ./src all
4. In the telnet: reset halt;flash write_image erase ./cfa735.elf.hex;reset
5. In the telnet: reset 
6. Compile CFA735 tests: cd test; make
7. Run the test: ./example-635 /dev/ttyACM0 115200. You should see 4 text lines on the LCD screen
